This is Aero a theme for GKT 2.x. It is an inverse Aqua-style theme, in
which the gas phase and the liquid phase have been switched.

The most recent version of Aero can be found at themes.freshmeat.net.


INSTALLATION
------------

Just unpack into your ~/.themes directory and use gconf-editor to switch
theme. 

Unfortunately Nautilus seems to disrespect Aero theme settings, when
using the icon view. This can be solved by creating a new background
color (color value is #37383F), and drag it onto the icon view pane.
Nautilus automagically switches the icon title color to white.

Create a new background color (from the Nautilus online help file):

To add a color to the colors that you can use on your screen components,
choose Edit-> Backgrounds and Emblems. Click on the Colors button, then
click on the Add New Color button. A color selector dialog is displayed.
Use the color wheel or the sliders to choose the color (enter #37383F
here). Click OK to add the new color to the Backgrounds and Emblems
dialog.
